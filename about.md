# Xinze Zhang

Xinze Zhang is currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Management, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), China. He is also a team member of John Hopcroft Lab, School of Computer Science and Technology, HUST.

His research interests include deep learning, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. Most recently, he focuses on the adversarial generation for neural machine translation (NMT), randomness in deep neural network (DNN), and DNN based time series forecasting models.

He received a B.A. degree in accounting in 2015 from Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, China. He received his M.P.Ac. degree in accounting in 2018 from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.
