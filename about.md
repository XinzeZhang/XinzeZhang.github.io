        I am currently a Ph.D. student in School of Management, [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), China. I am also affiliated with [John Hopcroft Lab](http://mathcenter.hust.edu.cn/Research_Groups/John_Hopcroft_Lab_for_Data_Science.htm), School of Computer Science and Technology, HUST.

      My research interests lie primarily in machine learning, especially for natural language processing, and time series forecasting. Most recently, I focus on the adversarial attack for neural machine translation (NMT), randomness in deep neural network (DNN), and DNN based time series forecasting models.
