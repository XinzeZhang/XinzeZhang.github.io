### Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify"   markdown='1'>
In recent years, deep neural networks have been widely employed for neural modulation recognition (NMR) in the electronic field. However, the NMR models are usually sensitive to the noisy input signals. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called SNR-aware adaptive feature selection (SAFS) to mitigate the noise effects by adaptively subsampling the input signal with a binary subsampling operator for varying SNR environments, enabling the model to focus on more salient and indicative positions. Besides, we iteratively update the binary subsampling operator and the NMR model to enhance the coordination between the data-driven NMR model and dynamically selected signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all baselines and effectively improves the state-of-the-art NMR models.
