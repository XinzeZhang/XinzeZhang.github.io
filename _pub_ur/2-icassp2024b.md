### Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify"   markdown='1'>
Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is of great importance in the field of electromagnetics, and deep neural networks have achieved promising progress on the AMC task. In this regard, we propose a novel model architecture called multi-channel convolutional distilled Transformer (MCDformer). In MCDformer, we first effectively leverage the frequency-domain information to enhance the denoising process of input signals. After extracting waveform features from the input signals using the convolutional neural network backbone, we employ Transformer blocks to learn the correlations among different features. Besides, we introduce a convolutional layer with max-pooling to distill the features between the stacked blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MCDformer model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art AMC models.
