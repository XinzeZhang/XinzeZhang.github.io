### Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify"   markdown='1'>
Time series forecasting plays an important role in various real-world applications.
Due to the inner uncertainty and instability of the time series, crafting a promising and robust time series predictor is pretty challenging. To tackle this issue, we introduce an open framework, called OpenForecasting, for time series forecasting. By integrating current powerful neural network modeling framework and state-of-the-art parameter optimization software, OpenForecasting can provide the define-by-run models to effectively solve the forecasting problem. Further, we present the standardized full modeling pipeline, including data preprocessing, model construction, hyperparameters optimization, and results evaluation. This allows for easy implementation of different model architectures as well as optimization algorithms, enabling different models to be compared conveniently and fairly. Our framework is available at https://github.com/Analytics-for-Forecasting/OpenForecasting.
