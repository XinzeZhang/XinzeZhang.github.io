### Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify" markdown='1'>

Time series forecasting is of great importance in many real-world applications.
The echo state network (ESN), a popular type of recurrent neural network (RNN) with random weights, is widely used as an efficient alternative to fully training RNN for time series forecasting.
Since learning the weights parameters in ESN only involves the calculation of the output weights and is determined by the mapping between the targets and the hidden states, making it crucial to craft an appropriate mapping for the ESN-based predictor.

<!-- Thus, feature selection is also an important issue in ESN, which directly affects the hidden state set, so as to impact the performance. 
To address these problems, a novel approach called ternary memetic algorithm based ESN (TMA-ESN) is proposed for time series forecasting, which provides a framework that unifies feature-state selection and parameter optimization of the ESN for time series forecasting. -->
